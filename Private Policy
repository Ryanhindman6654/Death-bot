Data we collect: 

 The only data we collect is the Server user count.
 
 Why do we need this data:
  The user count is displayed on the v!stats command output. We do NOT get a list of who is in what server or what server it is.
  
  We do not share data with anyone.
  
  If you need to contact me for more info or for any concerns you may do so eithe by email ryan.hindman12@ryansprogramming.tech or by discord deathkiller12234#0010
  
  Once again we only store the user count.
