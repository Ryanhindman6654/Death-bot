Data we collect: 

 The only data we collect is the Server user count, Guilds name and the owner user and tag. 
 
 Why do we need this data:
  The user count is displayed on the v!stats command output. We do not get a list of who is in what server but we do get a list of the server name.
  
  We do not share data with anyone.
  
  If you need to contact me for more info or for any concerns you may do so eithe by email ryan.hindman12@ryansprogramming.tech or by discord deathkiller12234#1893
  
  Once again we only store the user count, Guilds name and the owner user and tag.
